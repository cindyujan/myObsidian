Title: "Integrating Communication and Task–Technology Fit Theories: The Adoption of Digital Media in Learning"
ShortSummary: The academic article on the web page presents a model that integrates communication and task–technology fit theories to examine the effects of digital media use on students’ satisfaction and academic performance in higher education. The study, conducted with 1330 students at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, finds that both technological, task, and social characteristics, and online communication, motives for communicating, communication self-efficacy, and attitude toward use, have significant associations with students’ satisfaction and academic performance. The article concludes that task–technology fit and communication theory for using digital media enhance students’ active learning and enable effective exchange of knowledge, information, and discussions, suggesting that students and educators should leverage digital media platforms to further their educational goals.
