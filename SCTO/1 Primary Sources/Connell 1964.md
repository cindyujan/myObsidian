# The Ecological Regulation of Species Diversity


> [!tldr] Summary 4/5
> Primary production begets diversity. because more energy means bigger populations and more possibilities to speciate. More species leads to a feedback loop of overspecialization that makes populations more vulnerable to shifting environments. 

> [!quote] Quotable
> In their landmark paper [Connel and Orias] identify a novel way of predicting biodiversity from primary production.


### Aim of Paper
What brings about diversity? i.e. "more species"

### Insights
- Niche can only be described a posteriori. 
	- Niche as a profession and a professor is not a niche filled, but a niche **created**.
- More niches does not mean more species for that reason. 
- Diversity is determined by amount of energy flowing through the food web. Hence, productivity may limit diversity.


#### Key Theory
- Living systems operate better at homeostatic conditions. 

- Energy available to a system (i.e. sunlight) splits into "Maintenance" and "Productivity". The first to make homeostatic conditions, the second to reproduce. 
	- **Productivity** is stored in matter
	- **Maintenance** is dissipated as "heat"

- Larger populations means more variability and this leads to the potential to create new species, if they are for example spatially or temporally isolated. Hence more energy => more Diversity. 

- first nutrient cycling is limited to detritus, then later something evolves to be "faster" i.e. eat nutrients right off the leaf and then something else to take advantage of these (i.e. predators).

- The number of pathways for energy flow is a good indicator of stability in it. 

- Model deals only with equilibrium states
