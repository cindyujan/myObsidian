# The ABC of systematic literature review: the basic methodological guidance for beginners
*Hayrol Azril Mohamed Shaffril, Samsul Farid Samsuddin & Asnarulkhadi Abu Samah*

> [!tldr] Summary
> I found this paper interesting because it offers a comprehensive and practical overview of the SLR process, with examples and tips for each step. It also discusses the challenges and limitations of SLR, and provides suggestions for future improvement.

> [!quote] Quotable
> "A systematic literature review aims to comprehensively locate and synthesise related research using organised, transparent, and replicable procedures at each step in the process."ยน
> 
> "SLR has several advantages compared to traditional review such as its numerous unique procedures. SLR encourages researchers to look for studies outside their own subject areas and networks through the introduction of extensive searching methods, predefined search strings, and standard inclusion and exclusion criteria."ยน


### Aim of Paper
- To present a beginner's guide to the basic methodological guides and key points of performing SLR, especially for those from non-health related background.
- To address the issues related to the lack of methodological references in SLR and less suitability of existing methodological guidance for non-health researchers.
- To contribute to the advancement of SLR as a rigorous and reliable research method.

#### Key insights
- SLR consists of seven main points: (1) the development and validation of the review protocol/publication standard/reporting standard/guidelines, (2) the formulation of research questions, (3) systematic searching strategies, (4) quality appraisal, (5) data extraction, (6) data synthesis, and (7) data demonstration.
- Each point has its own sub-steps, challenges, and best practices, which are explained and illustrated with examples in the paper.
- SLR is not a flawless method, and it faces some limitations such as the availability and accessibility of data, the quality and consistency of data, the subjectivity and bias of reviewers, and the time and resource constraints.
- SLR can be improved by adopting more rigorous and transparent standards, using more advanced and automated tools, involving more diverse and qualified reviewers, and integrating more interdisciplinary and innovative approaches.
