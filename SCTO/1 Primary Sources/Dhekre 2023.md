Title: "Exploring the Challenges of Diagnosing Thyroid Disease with Imbalanced Data and Machine Learning: A Systematic Literature Review"
ShortSummary: The article is a systematic literature review that explores the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques for diagnosing thyroid disease, particularly when dealing with imbalanced data. It provides an overview of thyroid disease, its types, causes, symptoms, and diagnosis methods, and discusses the challenges of using these techniques, such as data quality, bias, reliability, and imbalance issues. The review follows the PRISMA guidelines and includes 168 articles in the meta-analysis and 41 articles in the content analysis. The findings from the review identify gaps and challenges in the existing literature and suggest directions for future research. The article is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the application of machine learning and deep learning in healthcare, specifically for thyroid disease diagnosis.

### Aim of Paper
The aim of the paper is to provide a systematic literature review (SLR) of the existing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods for diagnosing thyroid disease, especially when dealing with imbalanced data1. The paper also identifies the gaps and challenges in the current research and suggests directions for future work. The paper uses the following research questions to guide the SLR:

- What are the existing DL and ML-based approaches for diagnosing thyroid disease?
- What are the current techniques for dealing with datasets with an imbalanced class ratio?

#### Key insights
- - The web page is a **scientific article** that reviews the current state of the art in using **machine learning** and **imbalanced data** to diagnose **thyroid disease**.
- Thyroid disease is a common and serious condition that affects the thyroid gland, which regulates metabolism and other bodily functions. It can be classified into seven types, such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroid cancer.
- Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that can analyze large amounts of data and recognize patterns that may not be evident to human doctors. It can improve the accuracy and efficiency of thyroid disease diagnosis by using various algorithms, such as support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and deep learning.
- Imbalanced data is a challenge that occurs when one class of data is significantly more prevalent than others, leading to biased and inaccurate predictions. Several techniques can be used to address this issue, such as oversampling, undersampling, and synthetic data generation.
- The article conducts a **systematic literature review** of 168 papers published between 2013 and 2022, and analyzes 41 papers in detail. It uses various criteria to evaluate the studies, such as thyroid disease type, machine learning algorithm, imbalance solution, and performance metric.
- The article identifies the **gaps and limitations** of the existing studies, such as the lack of real-world data, the limited use of deep learning algorithms, the insufficient consideration of data quality and interpretability, and the need for more clinical validation and deployment. It also provides **future research directions** and recommendations for improving the field.
