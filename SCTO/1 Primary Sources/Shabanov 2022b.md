# A prelimenary analysis of tools for note taking


> [!tldr] Summary
> While MS Word is popular among academics the reasons lie in familiarity and availability, rather than quality. Notes in Word are hard to interlink and to search collectively. Evernote and Notion are two popular apps that solve a lot of the connectivity issues. The data for those resides on a server, which makes work sometimes slow, has issues with data safety and lastly hides features behind a paywall. 


## Aim of paper
To analyse shortcoming of MS Word, Notion and Evernote. 

**MS Word**:
- ⛔️ Slow and "overloaded" for note taking
- ⛔️ Notes reside in files that are not easy to search collectively
- ⛔️ Files cannot be easily linked together. 
- ⛔️ Embedding of one file in another or PDFs inside word documents is not possible. 
- ✅ Easily accessible for most academics 
- ✅ Familiar and shareable to most
- ✅ Own the data. It is on your PC. 

**Evernote, Notion:** 
- ⛔️ Data is stored on corporate servers
- ⛔️ Dependence on being online, which leads to slow down offline. 
- ⛔️ Cost money for certain features (like storing bigger files or syncing multiple devices)
- ⛔️ Usually a single vault or collection of notes.
- ⛔️ Not easy to export all content should one decide to migrate away from these tools
- ✅ Notes can be connected and files embedded
- ✅ Easy to edit notes


**Conclusion**

While Notion and Evernote are great tools (as commercial tools should be). They have short comings. However it should be a personal choice which tool to use. 

Obsidian has a huge comunity and tends to be "hackable" which enables a lot of cool features that will not be available by other tools. Like creating scripts that operate directly on the data files. 

> I have created a variety of custom scripts that enable to import and export files and PDFs that we will cover on the [blog](https://ilyashabanov.substack.com/) shortly.
