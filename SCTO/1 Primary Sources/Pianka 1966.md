# Latitudinal gradients in species diversity: a review of concepts


> [!tldr] Summary 3/5
> Review of 6 major theories of what causes species diversity, especially higher diversity in the tropics. But no clear answer is given which is more probable.

- Many animal taxa display latitudinal gradients. 

### Aim of paper
What factors allow ecological co-existence of more species at low latitudes?
Six or more hypothesis:
1. Time theory
2. Spatial heterogeneity
3. Competition hypothesis
4. Predation hypothesis
5. theory of climatic stability
6. productivity hypothesis

**Ecological and Evolutionary Saturation:**  Upper limits on number supported by given habitat. (with reasonable evidence that it is already true for the majority of habitats)

### 1. Time Theory
All communities tend to diversify and older communities therefore are more diverse.
Argument assumes that northern temperate communities had no time as they didn't exist as long (they could also have shifted and would have had the time...)
Only applicable for habitats that are not yet ecologically saturated (but most are). 

### 2. Theory of Spatial Heterogeneity
The more rich rich the topography the more species it supports. MacArthur showed that foliage height is a good predictor of bird species diversity, while adding plant species to it, has no impact on prediction. 
→ can only explain local diversity, not global gradients from pole to pole. 

### 3. The competition hypothesis
More competition → smaller niches/specialisation (as they offer an advantage) → more species
In tropics drought or cold do not occur often and natural selection takes a different course in the tropics (i.e. increase competition). Because catastrophic mortality forces selection towards fecundity and accelerated development and NOT competitive ability.

### 4. Predation Hypothesis
Tropics have more predators → smaller and less competing pray populations → new species can fill less competed niches → new predators can evolve → increase in species diversity. 
(is in direct opposition to competition hypothesis, since here less competition makes more species )

### 5. Climatic stability
stable climates → allows evolution of finer specialisation/adaptation (resources are more constant and thus no generalists needed). → niches are thus smaller → more species occupying the same area. 

### 6. Productivity 
see [[Connell 1964]]
Longer seasons in tropics might allow species to partition the environment temporally as well resulting in more species coexisting.
