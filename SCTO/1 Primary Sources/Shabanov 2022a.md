# A novel system for academic note taking


> [!tldr] Summary
> 1. You gather your **primary sources** and create a note per source. Try to keep it concise and always tend to your meta data, it will be of much importance once your collection grows. 
> 2. When you find a small "atomic" bit of information put it into a **compendium** note and keep aggregating those until they get to large. At this point split them into multiple notes. 
> 3. Note down questions and ideas in **thinking notes** that you have around the whole topic. Make references and comparisons to your primary sources. Do not try to answer them right away, just note. 
> 4. Once reading your primary sources slows down to give you new insight, move on to reviewing your thinking notes, pruning what questions are already answered or ideas invalidated. 
> 5. Start writing ontologies, summaries and answers to your own questions as you go. 
> 6. Aim at making ontologies publishable and readable - something you can send to your colleague who doesn't know about your topic yet. These ontologies will be the basis of your next publication.
