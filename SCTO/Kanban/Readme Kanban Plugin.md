# Kanban plugin

The Kanban plugin is a community plugin that allows you to create and manage Kanban boards in your notes. A Kanban board is a visual tool that helps you organize your tasks, projects, and ideas into different columns and cards. Here are the basic steps to use the Kanban plugin in Obsidian:

- [Install and activate the plugin from the community plugins library in the settings page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB4WNMN97Gc)[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB4WNMN97Gc).
- Create a new note and switch to the Kanban view by clicking on the icon in the top-right corner of the editor.
- Add columns to your board by clicking on the plus icon at the bottom of the board. You can rename, delete, or reorder the columns by clicking on the three dots icon on the column header.
- Add cards to your columns by clicking on the plus icon at the bottom of each column. You can edit the card title and content as regular Markdown notes, and add tags, dates, checkboxes, links, images, and more to your cards.
- Drag and drop cards between columns to update their status, priority, or category. You can also drag and drop cards to other notes to link them or move them.
- Use the board header buttons to filter, sort, archive, or customize your board. You can also use Dataview queries to filter and sort your cards by various criteria.
