# All Calender Entries

This is a list of all calendar entries that we have. It is quite useful to keep track of Entries that might have been added a long time ago. 


```dataview
Table without id file.link as Date, Summary from "📆 Activity"
```

# Open Todos

I can add todos into my daily tasks and show them here in one list. 

```dataview
TASK from "📆 Activity" 
```

----

# Timeline 

An example timeline displaying one dot per source note I have added on that day. It gives me an overview of how much i have read. Just as a motivation

```dataview
Calendar file.ctime from "1️⃣ Primary Sources"
```
