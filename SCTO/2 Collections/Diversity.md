> This is an example compendium to the topic of Biodiversity and its origins. Note how all the different statements are linked to the original source. With some being linked to reference withing that source. 
> Also note that the first Block on Shannon Diversity has a small number behind it. It is because I linked this block in [[Biodiversity Mechanisms]], which is a handy way of referring to parts of the document. While this is a good way to do it, moving this block into a separate note might sometimes be problematic.  

Shannon diversity index: $H=-\sum_{i}\; p_i\;log\;p_i$ is most popular for estimation, as it takes into account different population sizes. [[Connell 1964]] ^6a8f55

Diversity is determined by amount of energy flowing through the food web. [[Connell 1964]]


increases with larger population sizes [[Connell 1964|Darwin 1859 in Connell 1964]]

More abundant species of fish have more different types of parasites [[Connell 1964|Dogiel 1961 in Connell 1964]]

Increased stability of complex food webs result in an increased diversity of species. [[Connell 1964]]

Increased stability of complex food webs result in an increased diversity of species. [[Connell 1964|Hutchinson 1959 in Connell 1964]] (bc the quicker something response to a change in homeostatic variables, the smaller the amplitude of the change.)


The larger an organism is the more mobile and therefore less likely to speciate and diversify. Therefore smaller organisms have more species [[Connell 1964]]

More complex, more diverse ecosystems have lower ratio of primary production (i.e. sun energy) to total biomass (i.e. net production). [[Connell 1964]]

More complex, more diverse ecosystems have lower ratio of primary production (i.e. sun energy) to total biomass (i.e. net production). [[Connell 1964|Margalef 1963 in Connell 1964]]

Animals in more productive communities are more sedentary so that species tend to be broken in different sub-populations and thus can speciate more readily [[Connell 1964]]
