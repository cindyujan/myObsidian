> [!NOTE] Explanation
> This note is an example "concept". I find concepts to be bite-size compendium pieces, that are easy to quote and reference. Things like "laws" or "defintions" or "themes" can go as a note into Concepts. However if you find it confusing just skip it - or introduce your own classification. 
> Instead of folders you can also work with tags - there is indeed a debate in the community folders vs tags. Find your own way - I prefer a mixture. 

For Maximum stability, the variety of homeostatic responses = variety of environmental challenges (i.e. the more challenging the environment, the more complex the reg. system or organisms therein?)
[[Connell 1964|Ashby 1958 in Connell 1964]]


Energy available to a system (i.e. sunlight) splits into "Maintenance" and "Productivity". The first to make homeostatic conditions, the second to reproduce. 
	- **Productivity** is stored in matter
	- **Maintenance** is dissipated as "heat"
[[Connell 1964]]

â†’ Therefore the less energy is needed for maintenance, the more can go into reproduction. Related to increase in [[Diversity]]
