> [!NOTE] Explanation
> This is a small example of an ontology that refers to factual pieces from the [[Diversity]] compendium. The sources in the ontology are however primary sources. So that it becomes directly a publishable piece of document. 
> It is of course hard to write anything sensible on a broad topic as biodiversity with only 2 primary sources - but it is a start. 


Different ideas have been proposed through the years for what defines biodiversity [[Pianka 1966]]. However the short answer at this point is we do not know. It depends on what scale we look at. On a global scale it seems that simply latitude is a great predictor of biodiversity. On a local scale [[Connell 1964]] suggest that the amount of sunlight or primary production might be the corresponding quantity to look for. 

*and so on and so forth...*
